  {
    q: "What does it take to host a challenge?",
    a: 'Challenge partners propose a real, <span class="font-semibold">non-confidential</span> biological, computational, or data-driven problem (e.g. workflows, datasets, analytical pipelines, conceptual challenges). Teams work intensively over the hackathon to prototype solutions, analyses, or tools.',
  },
  {
    q: "What is expected from challenge providers?",
    a: 'Challenges are intended to be <span class="font-semibold">exploratory and prototype-focused</span>, suitable for a 2-3 day hackathon. Challenge providers are expected to define the <span class="font-semibold">problem statement, context, and success criteria</span>, but not to deliver production-ready software or fully validated pipelines.<br /><br /><span class="font-semibold">Technical support expectations</span><br />Challenge providers may support participants in one or more of the following ways:<br />- Providing links to documentation, tutorials, or example repositories (e.g. via intro slides at the opening ceremony)<br />- Delivering an optional short workshop or Q&A session (up to 1 hour) on the relevant tools, workflows, or domain context<br />- Answering clarification questions and offering domain guidance during the event<br /><br />There is <span class="font-semibold">no expectation of continuous engineering support</span>, debugging of individual team environments, or on-call maintenance throughout the hackathon.<br /><br /><span class="font-semibold">Deployment and executability</span><br />The organising team will carry out <span class="font-semibold">best-effort pre-event sanity checks</span> (e.g. dependencies, basic executability) where needed, but full deployment validation or production-level robustness is out of scope. Teams are encouraged to focus on proof-of-concept implementations, workflow design, and methodological exploration.<br /><br /><span class="font-semibold">Compute and infrastructure</span><br />The University of Edinburgh will provide:<br />- Access to the Edinburgh University\'s <span class="font-semibold">Eddie HPC cluster</span>, including GPU resources where appropriate<br />- Pre-hackathon onboarding and guidance on accessing computing resources<br />- OpenAI API access for teams working on LLM-enabled challenges<br /><br />Challenge providers are welcome (but not required) to advise on expected compute requirements or known installation/dependency issues in advance, in their introduction slide(s) or Q&A sessions.<br /><br /><span class="font-semibold">Overall intent</span><br />The goal is to keep the burden on challenge providers <span class="font-semibold">low and well-defined</span>, while enabling participants to meaningfully explore real scientific and technical problems in a supported, well-resourced environment',

  {
    q: "What level of presence is expected from sponsors?",
    a: 'We ask challenge partners to:<br />- Attend the opening ceremony (Friday 20 March, afternoon) to introduce their challenge<br />- Attend the final judging, awards, and closing ceremony (Sunday 22 March, afternoon)<br />- Optional attendance on Saturday for Q&As and mentoring during hacking sessions',
  },
  {
    q: "What does the BioHackathon provide for sponsors?",
    a: 'We provide:<br />- A <span class="font-semibold">sponsor stall</span> during the weekend<br />- Structured networking sessions with participants<br />- Visibility across event materials and communications<br />- A 5-10 min slot for a short challenge introduction at the opening ceremony (afternoon of Friday 20 March)<br />- The opportunity to <span class="font-semibold">host a 1-hour workshop or technical session</span> (e.g. explaining a workflow, tool, dataset, or domain challenge)',
  },
  {
    q: "Can sponsors deliver technical training (e.g. Snakemake)?",
    a: 'Yes. Training can be delivered either:<br />- As part of the <span class="font-semibold">pre-hackathon workshop series</span> (late Feb-mid March), or<br />- On <span class="font-semibold">Day 1 of the hackathon</span> as a technical workshop<br /><br />We can also integrate sponsor-led training alongside academic-led sessions (e.g. Git, Python, Snakemake), depending on preference.',
  },
  {
    q: "Do sponsors need to provide prizes?",
    a: 'We ask each challenge partner to contribute prizes for winning teams in their track (typically 4-6 people per team).<br /><br />Prizes may include:<br />- Company merchandise or digital products<br />- Internship, shadowing, or fast-track interview opportunities<br />- Other incentives relevant to your area of science or technology',
  },
  {
    q: "Are sponsors expected to contribute financially?",
    a: 'Covering travel costs for your own staff attending the event is expected.<br />If budget allows, <span class="font-semibold">a small financial contribution</span> towards event operations (e.g. catering, participant travel grants, materials) is greatly appreciated and helps ensure the sustainability of the Bio-Innovation Series, but this is not a strict requirement.',
  },
  {
    q: "Is the BioHackathon suitable for recruitment and talent scouting?",
    a: 'Yes. The event is explicitly designed to showcase participants\' technical ability, problem-solving skills, teamwork, and communication. We strongly encourage sponsors to bring both <span class="font-semibold">technical staff</span> and <span class="font-semibold">careers/talent representatives</span>.',
  },
  {
    q: "How do we propose a challenge or get involved?",
    a: 'Interested academics, companies, or organisations can contact the organising team at <span class="font-semibold"><a href="mailto:ian.yang@ed.ac.uk">ian.yang@ed.ac.uk</a></span>.<br />Challenge proposals are collected via a short <span class="underline"><a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=sAafLmkWiUWHiRCgaTTcYTZ7z7jT_5pAghc_xopHj-tUMUgwSUU2V0g5VkVGMkJWVVk3SjM1TUtZSi4u">MS Form</a></span>, with a submission deadline of 30 January 2026.',
